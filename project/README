To Run this program you will need:
- python3
- cmake
- cutlass library
*Note: In src/CmakeList.txt if you want to ignore the cutlass dependency remove references to cutlass ( I am not great with cmake and couldn't get that issue to handle nicely )*

To compile:
create a build dir in the project root dir
cd into the direcory and run cmake ..
run make

Running:
The binaries are located in <project_root>/build/src
passing nothing into the binaries will show available arguments
the run script is located in <project_root>/util/scripts which was used to generate all data.
